The Furniture
=============

The Furniture is shopping android application for furniture. This project is made by two people and the front end part is done by my friend.
I was responsible for database and backend part. This project will be no longer updated, since I do not want to re-engineer the
front end. This project uses Firebase CloudStore to all the data. Personally, I do not recommend using Firebase or real-time database
for this kind of application, but I chose to use it because I wanted to try CloudStore.

The application will contain the following features:
1. Sign in
2. Log in
3. Search products by category and name
4. Add to cart
5. Purchase at point
6. View and edit cart
7. Edit user's information

Installation
------------
To run the program, you might have to construct your own Firebase database and change the Authentication.
You can connect to your own Firebase database by going to.

`Tools -> Firebase -> Realtime Database` and follow the steps they provide.

After you finished connecting the project to the Firebase database, you can run the project using any IDE you preferred.

Screenshots
-----------
The new screenshots will be taken once I finish integration to .NET Core API.
